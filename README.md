# osu!Playground

I don't like the current *osu!* editor. For a person like me who likes interesting geometry, perfection is difficult to achieve using it alone.

As such, I decided to make this, **osu!playground**. It allows a user to make their own patterns using code and math, then export them into their own *osu!* maps by copying the code.

**If you want to download this now, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Poyo-SSB/osu-playground/releases).**

You'll need some scripts to actually do anything with it, so take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Poyo-SSB/osu-playground/wiki) to get started.

## Controls

* <kbd>Left Click</kbd> + drag - move control point
* <kbd>Right Click</kbd> + drag - move all control points
* <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> + drag - pan playfield
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + scroll - zoom

## FAQ

#### **Help! There's nothing on the playfield to change.**
You need to load a script first. Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Poyo-SSB/osu-playground/wiki) for examples. 

#### **Why's your code so terrible?**
My code is terrible primarily because I don't know what I'm doing, and this is really a temporary project I don't plan to maintain actively.

Instead, I hope to be able to add similar functionality into osu!lazer when the time comes.

That being said, I will fix issues when I can and will review pull requests if they're submitted.

#### **I found a serious issue!**
Feel free to report it on the [issues](https://github.com/Poyo-SSB/osu-playground/issues) section of this repository.
